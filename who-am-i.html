      <h1> A Little Bit About Me </h1>
      <p> Yes, this is a website designed to introduce my resume and my past works. However,  I feel like this only introduces a part of me. A part of me who is a learner and a worker. Thus, I decided to write this brief section that reveals who I am as a person. <br> <br>
A turning point in my life was when I had to live abroad in Germany. I was only 8 years old, and honestly, despite the fact that it was my first time experiencing Western culture or even seeing foreign people, I had a lot of fun. My passion in soccer was especially skyrocketing that I managed to become the school's goal keeper despite being the shortest kid. I still remember conflicting between supporting South Korea and Germany in one of the friendly matches.<br> <br>
When I came back to Korea, it was really hard for me to adjust. A lot of students already had their own friend groups, and the cultural difference made me difficult to sink in. There was this one friend, however, who helped me to adjust to this new environment. He taught me basketball for the first time, introduced me to his friends, and most importantly, explored through the local restaurants to find the best ones! Thanks to him, I was able to create new personal relationships that I happily maintain today. <br> <br>
Now, I have entered a new community in WashU adjusting to another culture with great friends. While my passion is in computer engineering, I do not want to be restricted in this field. At the end of the day, my goal is to use the knowledge I have to help others to enjoy this adventure of cultural adaption that I had for sure. </p>
