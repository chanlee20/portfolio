      <h1> A Little Bit About Me </h1>
      <p> Yes, this is a website designed to introduce my resume and my past accomplishments. However,  I feel like this only introduces a part of me. A part of me who is a learner and a worker. Thus, I decided to write this brief section that reveals who I am as a person. <br> <br>
A turning point in my life was when I decided to live abroad in Germany. I was only 8 years old, and honestly, despite the fact that it was my first time experiencing Western culture or even seeing foreign people, I had a lot of fun. My passion in soccer was specifically skyrocketing that I managed to become the school's goal keeper despite being the shortest player. I still remember conflicting between rooting for South Korea and Germany in the World Cup.<br> <br>
When I came back to Korea, there existed an immense challenge for me to adjust. A lot of students already had their own friend groups, and the cultural difference made me difficult to blend in. There was this one friend, however, who helped me to adjust to this new environment. He taught me basketball for the first time, introduced me to his friends, and most importantly, explored through the local restaurants to find the best ones! Thanks to him, I was able to create new personal relationships that I maintain today. <br> <br>
Now, I have entered a new community in WashU adjusting to another culture with great friends. While my passion is in computer science, I do not want to be restricted in this field. At the end of the day, my goal is to utilize my knowledge to share the joy of working as a team. </p> <br>
